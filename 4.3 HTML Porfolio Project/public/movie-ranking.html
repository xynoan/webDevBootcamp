<h1>The Best Anime According to Carlo</h1>
<h2>My top 3 anime of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>3-gatsu no Lion</h3>
<p>A 17 years old kid I can relate myself to.</p>
<h3>One Piece</h3>
<p>
  The main character, Luffy, demonstrates very well how to succeed in life in all
  circumstances.
</p>
<h3>Hyouka</h3>
<p>
  The main character, Hotarou, likes solving real-life problems. Which I would
  never find myself liking exactly the same thing in the future.
